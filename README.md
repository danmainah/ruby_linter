# ruby_linter
# About 
  
  This idea of making your workflow easier and reduce mistakes during coding is amazing 
  and believing you can create your own error checker is amazing.

  This project is about creating a linter for ruby files using ruby 

  # The Build
  The  Ruby linter currently detects for the following errors.
- check for missing emptyline at the end
- check for trailing spaces
- check for long lines that need to be shortened
- check for empty startline
- check empty line error

> Below are demonstrations of good and bad code for the above cases. I will use the pipe '|' symbol to indicate cursor position where necessary.
> # check for empty startline
---the good code

class Calculator
  attr_accessor :x, :y

  puts 'an example of how the calculator class works you call the method outside the class.'
  def initialize(num1, num2)
    @x = num1
    @y = num2
  end
  
 ---the bad code

# To check for errors on a file
 -In the downloader main Dir
 -Run bin/main.rb

 ## Testing

To test the code, run `rspec` from root of the folder using terminal.
Note: `testfile.rb` has been excluded from rubocop checks to allow RSpec testing without interfering with Gitflow actions
